# device-monitor-sharp
Simple .NET 5 console Application to get some basic system information like CPU load, memory,... 
This project is in an very early stage of development, so some things are a bit hacky currently.

**Currently it only runs on linux**

## Todo
- Add some way to continuously deliver the json with current up to date values (simple Webserver?)
- Implment more data
- Website to display json data?
- Windows support
